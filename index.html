My name is Norm!<br><br><br>
      I was recently kicked out of my apartment by my roommate and I need a place to stay.<br>
      Here is my craigslist listing. I have more details there.<br> I've never done one before,
      but if you're interested in having me as a roommate let me know. <br><br><br>

     Some people might think I am strange to be asking personal stuff
      over the interent but this is<br>due to me being in desperate circumstances. So to prove
      I am not weird, here is my Linkedin.<br>I am also trying to find a job, but don't worry I 
      do have money saved up.<br><br><br>
